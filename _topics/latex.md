LaTeX is a formatting language for documents with lots of math notation in them.

It is the work of two mathmetician/computer scientists:
* Donald Knuth, who write TeX
* Leslie Lamport, to develope LaTeX on top of TeX.

# Pronounciation

It is pronounced "lay tek" because
* TeX is "tau epsilon chi", as in "technology"
* TeX is not "Tex" as in "Texas"

# Examples

|What you write | What you get |
|---------------|---------------|
|` \frac{1}{n}` | $$ \frac{1}{n} |
